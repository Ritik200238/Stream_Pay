## Script (Read naturally, not rushed)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
**[Show browser at localhost:3000]**

"Hi! I'm demonstrating StreamPay - a real-time payment streaming platform built on Linera for the Wave 3 Buildathon.

Notice the green banner at the top? That shows we're connected to Conway Testnet right now."

**[Point to green banner: "✅ Connected to Conway Testnet | Chain: ff869722..."]**

---

### The Problem (0:20 - 0:35)
**[Scroll to comparison banner]**

"Traditional payroll takes 30 days. Ethereum takes 12+ seconds per transaction.

StreamPay on Linera? Under 50 milliseconds. That's the power of microchains."

---

### The Killer Feature (0:35 - 1:05)
**[Scroll to "Your Streams" section]**

"Here's the magic - look at this live counter. It's updating in real-time, every second, showing money flowing.

**[Watch counter tick up for 5 seconds]**

This isn't a demo. This is actually connected to our deployed Stream application on Conway Testnet."

**[Point to App ID in footer]**

"You can see our Stream App ID right here - fc1399ce... fully deployed and operational."

---

### Creating a Stream (1:05 - 1:35)
**[Scroll back to Create Stream form]**

"Let me create a new payment stream."

**[Fill in form while talking]**
- Recipient: `User:0x1234567890abcdef` (type any valid format)
- Rate: `278` (already filled)
- Duration: `3600` (already filled)

"278 atto per second equals about $1 per hour. Perfect for freelance work or subscriptions."

**[Click "Create Stream"]**

**[Wait for success message]**

"Stream created! And there it is - already counting up in real-time."

---

### Use Cases (1:35 - 1:50)
**[Scroll to Use Cases section]**

"StreamPay works for:
- Payroll - pay employees every second they work
- Subscriptions - pay only for what you use
- Freelancing - get paid as you work
- Grants - continuous funding distribution"

---

### Technical Achievement (1:50 - 2:00)
**[Scroll back to top, show green banner again]**

"The entire stack is deployed:
- Token App for handling transfers
- Stream App for managing payment streams
- All running on Conway Testnet
- Frontend connected via GraphQL

Built with Rust smart contracts, React frontend, and the speed of Linera microchains."

---

### Closing (2:00 - 2:10)
**[Show footer]**

"StreamPay - Don't wait. Stream.

Thank you!"

## Backup Plan (If nervous about live recording):

Record in segments:
1. Record intro + problem (0:00 - 0:35)
2. Record killer feature (0:35 - 1:05)
3. Record creating stream (1:05 - 1:35)
4. Record use cases + closing (1:35 - 2:10)

Then combine using free video editor like DaVinci Resolve.

Good luck! You've got this! 🚀
